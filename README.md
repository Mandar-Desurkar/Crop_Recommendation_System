# Crop_Recommendation_System
This project creates a machine learning model to recommend the best crop and fertilizers for farmers. It uses historical agricultural data like crop yield, soil type, climate, and fertilizer usage to make personalized suggestions. The model employs supervised learning algorithms to predict crops and suggest fertilizers based on input factors. The goal is to help farmers optimize crop yield and reduce costs.Using machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and naive bayes, the model analyzes the input data and generates recommendations based on patterns and correlations. By harnessing the power of data-driven insights, this system aims to empower farmers with actionable information for better decision-making and improved agricultural outcomes.
